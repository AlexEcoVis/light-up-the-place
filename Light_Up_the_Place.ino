/*This sketch runs a system where three LEDs can be turned ON and OFF with the press of switches. Each LED activates/deactivates with the press of a specific switch. In each run, Arduino reads the state of the pin (ON or OFF) and keeps it as such, if no switch is pressed.*/// create variables for input pinsint GreenButton = 2;int YellowButton = 4;int RedButton = 6;// create variables for output pinsint GreenLED = 3;int YellowLED = 5;int RedLED = 7;// delay after button press (following LED activation-deactivation)// without delay, loop is run several times per press and the result// will be randomint DELAY = 400; // set pin modes (unecessary for inputs)void setup() {    // default state for output pins is LOW  pinMode(GreenLED, OUTPUT);  pinMode(YellowLED, OUTPUT);  pinMode(RedLED, OUTPUT);    // keep built-in LED off   pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);}void loop() {    // if green button is pressed  if (digitalRead(GreenButton) == HIGH){    if (digitalRead(GreenLED) == HIGH){ // if green led is on      digitalWrite(GreenLED, LOW); // shut green led off    }        else if (digitalRead(GreenLED) == LOW){ // if green led is off      digitalWrite(GreenLED, HIGH);    }    delay(DELAY); //delay to avoid running loop multiple times per press  }    // if yellow button is pressed  else if (digitalRead(YellowButton) == HIGH){    if (digitalRead(YellowLED) == HIGH){ // if yellow led is on      digitalWrite(YellowLED, LOW); // shut yellow led off    }        else if (digitalRead(YellowLED) == LOW){ // if yellow led is off      digitalWrite(YellowLED, HIGH);     }    delay(DELAY); //delay to avoid running loop multiple times per press  }      // if red button is pressed  else if (digitalRead(RedButton) == HIGH){    if (digitalRead(RedLED) == HIGH){ // if red led is on      digitalWrite(RedLED, LOW); // shut red led off    }        else if (digitalRead(RedLED) == LOW){ // if red led is off      digitalWrite(RedLED, HIGH);    }    delay(DELAY); //delay to avoid running loop multiple times per press  }    // else do nothing (keeps all LEDs in their state)    }
